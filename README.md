# SVM_Kernel_oneVSall_caltech101
This project is implementation of one vs all SVM kernel based on HOG transform feutures. In additional of an iterative algorithm was developed to find the optimal parameters

As part of the project, different models of SVM (kernel polynomial-based, kernel RBF-based, linear) were compared. An attempt was made to deduce how each parameter contributes to the accuracy of the machine and how normalization of the data affects accuracy.

The program displays the prediction result, a confusen matrix, and a table with the most incorrect classification in each category. In addition, the system maintains the classification and error results for Excel files on the user's computer.
